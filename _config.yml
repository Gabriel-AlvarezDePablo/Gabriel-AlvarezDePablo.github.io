about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Enthusiastic and creative multiplatform application and game developer with hands-on experience in C#, Java, and Python. Specialized in both software development and video game creation using Unity and Godot. Although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I have completed a six-month internship divided between customer support (hardware and systems) and software development with Python, gaining valuable real-world experience.

  I am known for my efficiency, quick learning, and problem-solving skills, often leading group projects and tackling challenges that others found difficult. My curiosity and collaborative spirit drive me to continuously improve and innovate, especially in the field of video game programming, where I enjoy designing mechanics and solving complex logic puzzles.

  Native Spanish speaker with a strong command of English, as I prefer to work and create in English whenever possible. I am seeking a position where I can feel comfortable, work as part of a team, and do what I am passionate about: programming and creating engaging experiences.

        title: "Spring Boot Learning: Product Service"
        link: https://github.com/Gabriel-AlvarezDePablo/product-service
        link_text: product-service
        quote: >
          A RESTful microservice for managing product catalog, built with Spring Boot 3 and containerized with Docker.
        description: |
          This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **microservices architecture** and **RESTful API design**.
          Built with **Java 21**, **Spring Boot 3.2**, and **Docker**, it provides a complete product catalog service
          with full CRUD functionality, in-memory database integration (H2), and CORS-enabled frontend support.

          Key aspects include:
          - Implemented CRUD operations using **Spring Data JPA**.
          - Designed and exposed **RESTful endpoints** for product management.
          - Integrated **H2 in-memory database** for lightweight development.
          - Containerized the service using **Docker** for environment consistency.
          - Configured **CORS policies** for frontend interaction.
          - Followed clean architecture principles with layered separation of concerns.

          Through this project, I deepened my understanding of **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, and **modern API development** while applying
          best practices in modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

      When I'm not coding, I love experimenting with ideas that mix creativity and logic.
      Some of my favorite pastimes are:

      - Developing small indie-style games and prototypes
      - Listening to and discovering new music
      - Tackling programming or math puzzles
      - Diving into video games and analyzing their mechanics
      - Learning new tools, engines, and technologies just for fun
